# BivalentKinetics

A simple MCMC scheme for sampling the stationary distribution of population of bivalent molecules interacting with a lattice of receptor sites. Used for generating data appearing in [https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07010](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07010).

## Implementation and instructions

The scheme is implemented in a Matlab `.m` script. Simply set the appropriate parameters (lattice size, run times etc.) and run the script.
